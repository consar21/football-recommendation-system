Football is the most popular sport globally and has significant cultural importance, influencing
society in numerous ways. This project focuses on the crucial aspect of player acquisition, which
is essential for club revenue and promoting cross-cultural interactions within Saudi Arabian
football teams. This aim to simplify the player acquisition process, allowing Saudi teams to
increase revenue by purchasing the best football players available locally. It will also enable
global teams to buy from Saudi Arabian football teams.
This project utilizes an expert system that considers various criteria such as player pace,
physicality, height, passing ability, number of goals, dribbling skills, market value, overall
rating, age, quick footwork, defending skill, and specific team requirements, including the
needed position. I have implemented this system using the logic programming language,
Prolog, and have demonstrated a rule-based implementation of the backward chaining strategy.
This approach enables the seamless acquisition of players who are ideal for specific positions.
Ultimately the objective is to assist Saudi Arabian football teams in becoming more profitable
and successful in the cutthroat and competitive football scene.
